  		I used to think that if everyone reduced energy consumption, the problem of global warming would go away. Until one day, a classmate and I got into an argument as he proclaimed that I did not have the right to force others to alter their lifestyle because we were all different, just as it isnâ€™t fair for a vegetarian to force me to turn vegan. Understanding his perspective, I realized that social issues, such as global warming, aren't simply a matter of changing lifestyles. Instead, the power of design with depth knowledge in energy sector is the true foundation as our society continues to progress forward in face of current and future challenges</p>
